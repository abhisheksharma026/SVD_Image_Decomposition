# SVD_Image_Decomposition
 
Using SVD to decompose an Image and restructure it back by using Eigen Values Diagonal Matrix. This lets us understand how a image can be factored by the singular value decomposition into constituent Matrix & the principal eigen values can be utilized to reconstruct the image or compress the image.
