# SVD_Image_Decomposition
 
Using SVD to decompose an Image and restructure it back by using Eigen Values Diagonal Matrix. This lets us understand how an image can be factored by the singular value decomposition into constituent Matrix & the principal eigen values can be utilized to compress the image or reconstruct the image.
